<p>
    Jesus came and told his disciples, â€œI have been
    given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore,
    go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
    them in the name of the Father and the Son and the
    Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the
    commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am
    with you always, even to the end of the age.
