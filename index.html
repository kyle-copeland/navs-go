    <p>Matthew 28:18-20</p>
    <p class="verse">
        Jesus came and told his disciples, â€œI have been
        given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore,
        go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
        them in the name of the Father and the Son and the
        Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the
        commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am
        with you always, even to the end of the age.
